//5. sort : asc / desc

//6. forEach(callbackfn) : alternative of for-of loop
//                         syntax : (callbckfn:(value,index,array)=>void)

//7. filter(callbackfn) : return new array with items satisfying condition from existing array.

//8. find(callbackfn) : return an items satisfying condition from existing array.

//9. map(callbackfn) : return a new array with values after applying a mapping fn to existing array.

//10. reduce(callbackfn) : return a single value which is either smallest / largest / total sum of an existing array.

//11. reduceRight(callbackfn) : return a single value which is either smallest / largest / which is the first item from an existing array after applying reduce fn.

//12. some(callbackfn) : return true  / false based on a condition applied to all items in given array.

//13. flat(depth) : return array with corresponding depth as dimension; reduce dimension by 1
//                  to convert to 1D use depth as 'Infinity'
